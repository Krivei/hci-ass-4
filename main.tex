	Waiting is generally regarded as part of a consumer's experience. While waiting, individuals may exhibit interesting behaviour tendencies that are not usually commented on. In this research, we explore these behaviours through an observation study. This was done at a Bratwurst stall, where the length of queue can be unpredictable. Three sessions were conducted separately on different times of the day, and then discussed on the similarities and differences. Results showed that most customers exhibited very similar behavioural patterns while waiting for their turn.

\section{Introduction}

Waiting in a queue occurs very frequently, and it has become a common phenomenon, especially during the purchase of a product. A queue is commonly associated with negative consumer experience \cite{Carmon1995}, therefore it has become an important factor for organisations to find solutions to this problem. However, queues can still occur, if the supply of people providing to these customers were inadequate \cite{Fagundes2017}. At present, no laws were erected to govern how a queue should be done, including whether cutting queue can be done, or how the structure of a queue should be formed. 

In Faguendes' findings, the norms of the line illustrates best what Robert Ellickson famously called "order without law". Everyone obeys this rule, but every problem encountered by individuals will provide an "unwritten sanction" based on their norms \cite{Fagundes2017}. This behaviour meant that every individual who wishes to join the line will stand behind the last person in the queue. This follows the psychology of conformity, where people look to others for cues. Once the queue is constructed, people will conform to the norms: maintain standing order, retain personal space norms and avoid cutting queues.

When queuing, people tend to exhibit peculiar actions to eliminate this drudgery. A study illustrates that the queuing behaviour can be influenced by the behaviour of people, distractions and environmental factors \cite{Furnham2020}. These actions can be clearly observed through an observation study. Therefore, in this research, we seek to understand how a formation could occur, and what are the typical behaviours customers would exhibit while waiting in line, through multiple observation sessions.

\section{Methodology}

Studying how individuals distribute attention across different household appliances during everyday cooking presents challenges, as attention shifts and coordination are difficult to capture in real time. Prior research addressed these challenges by employing re-enacted scenarios to capture interaction and routines \cite{Pink2017Design}. Drawing on insights from previous studies \cite{Buchenau2000}, the present study adopts re-enactment videos (REV), where they capture individuals re-enact a particular scenario from their everyday cooking. Video re-enactment was selected as it was an appropriate method to explore and understand participants' experiences, visible and hidden \cite{Pink2015DoingSensoryEthnography}. Themes were then developed through thematic analysis from the data.

To undertake this research, we focused on understanding how interaction was done with household appliances during cooking, and how attention could be distributed. Particular attention was paid to transitions between commonly used kitchen appliances, such as the refrigerator, stove and sink, which are commonly described as a ``kitchen work triangle''. This concept was only used as a guide to prioritise observation of kitchen appliances, and was not involved in the analytical framework. To adopt this method, we used visual techniques to record the actions, followed by a post-interview review of the recorded videos. During the re-enactment, participants were encouraged to think-aloud, to better understand their actions.

Prior to the main study, a pilot session was conducted to understand the re-enactment flow, video setup and prompting strategy. This session led to minor refinements to the study, including reducing prompting to avoid interruption and finding good angles for recording. Data from the pilot session were not included in the final analysis.

\subsection{Participants}

Recruited participants were initially screened to ensure they had prior experience with everyday home cooking and familiarity with using common household appliances. Three participants took part in the study, ranging in age from 24 to 30 years. Participants were recruited via convenience sampling, based on availability and willingness to take part in the study.

All participants reported cooking at home several times per week. They were all familiar with commonly used kitchen appliances, including a stove, refrigerator, and sink. One participant mentioned cooking for oneself, particularly for meal prep. Another participant reported a shift from cooking for household to only one due to a change in living situation. Cooking for household as a responsibility was noted for the third participant.

This study involved a small number of participants (N = 3) and was conducted in a domestic setting. This was done to focus on gaining in-depth insights in the experiences of individuals, on how attention and interaction are distributed across household appliances during everyday cooking, rather than statistical results.

\subsection{Materials}

Due to the nature of this study, participants were only required to perform re-enactments in their domestic kitchen environment. All participants provided consent prior to the participation. Only a recording device was required by the participant to capture interaction. No specialised equipment was provided to participants for the study. Data were collected remotely using Google Meet, which was used to record video and audio of cooking activities and participant commentary.

Recordings were transcribed using Condens.io to support qualitative analysis. Data were stored securely in a device accessible only to the researchers. To illustrate and pick key interaction sequences to supplement the analysis, video recordings were translated into participant-specific storyboards.

\subsection{Procedure}

During the screening session, participants were requested to select a recipe that they were comfortable with. In the re-enactment, they were asked to perform a cooking scenario based on the recipe. They were allowed to select a time context (e.g. lunch, dinner) which they find suitable for their selected recipe. Little guidance was given, besides giving them examples of the starting and ending point of a cooking process. We allowed these points to be freely selected by the participants, such that we could capture any insightful scenarios that may not be part of a cooking process such as cleaning up after dinner. These scenarios could help explain participant-specific interaction patterns observed during cooking.

This re-enactment was facilitated by one researcher, where limited prompts were given during the session for further understanding. The prompts were asked in each ``break'' \textemdash~ short sessions where participants transitioned from one sub-action to another, such as chopping to cooking \textemdash~ to ensure the process remains uninterrupted. While re-enacting, participants were encouraged to narrate on their interactions. They were also told that they should not reveal, say or answer anything that were felt uncomfortable. After this session, the researchers re-watched the video, noting down important actions and interactions that require more explanation. Another session, but not recorded, was done with the participants to assist in understanding the peculiar parts, supported by the recorded video.

\subsection{Spatial Context of Cooking Activities}

To complement the discussion of spatial movement and appliance coordination during the cooking activities, one participant consented to showing the kitchen floor plan. Therefore, a simplified schematic floor plan of the kitchen was drawn, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:context_1}. The floor plan illustrated only the main appliances that the participant often interact with. Exact dimensions of the kitchen layout were not recorded, as we only wanted to understand relative spatial relationships between appliances rather than precise measurements.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/p1_plan.png}
	\caption{\textbf{Schematic floor plan of the kitchen.} These dimensions were not representative of the owner's actual dimension.}
	\label{fig:context_1}
\end{figure}

Further understanding of the interaction with the stove was needed to support the interpretation of participants' interaction. This presented as a useful aid to actions that the video could not capture, due to viewing area limitations. The same participant also consented to the inclusion of a schematic sketch of the stove interface, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:context_2}.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/p1_cook.png}
	\caption{Schematic of the stove.}
	\label{fig:context_2}
\end{figure}

The stove contained two induction hobs, operated through electricity. The hob is turned on by holding the power button (placed at the right of +) for 2 seconds. The temperature is adjusted with the increase + and decrease - buttons around the display, located between the two buttons. The most left button was a child lock button, to prevent children from accidentally switching on the stove.

These two figures will be used to complement findings that require more elaboration and challenges that the participant had faced.

\subsection{Data Analysis}

Recordings and transcripts were stored in a cloud folder with password protection, and only shared among researchers involved in this study. These materials were used for thematic analysis \cite{BraunClarke2021}, where we identify recurring patterns to understand underlying meanings of participants in their cooking re-enactment. The transcripts were analysed for interesting quotes, retrieved and then placed in Figma for collaboration. 

We went through a five-stage process, with iteration when appropriate, following Braun and Clarke's guidance \cite{BraunClarke2021}. Each interesting quote was designated a code in the first cycle. The second stage involved refining codes, discarding duplicates and removing superfluous quotes. Patterns were found among codes, grouped and themes were later identified.

In addition, the videos were also analysed. Actions involving hands, routes, activities, materials used, senses and cues were recorded. Facial expression was also scrutinised when participants encountered challenges. To facilitate the understanding of relationships between actions and narrations, transcripts were viewed alongside with videos, and actions noted down. Separating these two presents a false construct because the narration may not accurately reflect the actions, frequently done unintentionally or not knowingly, and interesting insights may be omitted. Therefore, both resources were used together for the analysis.

\subsection{Discussion}
The results of this study suggest that attention during cooking may not be a static but a dynamic, distributed resource that is directed towards sensory feedback, risk mitigation, and spatial management.

The findings in sensory cues usage suggests that individuals distribute their attention towards multiple sensory channels. Rather than constantly staring at an appliance, individuals utilized auditory (sizzling sounds) and tactile (gauging pan temperature with hands) cues. This suggests that attention is highly multimodal, as individuals 'listen' and 'feel' for progress rather than just 'seeing'.

Furthermore, the findings also suggest that the switching between "experience-based judgement" and "precise measurement" may happen due to the attention shifts based on the perceived risk and familiarity of the task. Individuals were observed to narrow their attention towards precision instead of their own intuition whenever the perceived risk exceeds a certain threshold.

Finally, the study highlights that attention may not be solely focused on cooking tasks. A portion of the individuals attention was dedicated to "secondary" tasks, such as managing space constraints and maintaining hygiene. These behaviors are essential to maintain safety and workflow, showing that their attention and interactions were affected by the physical environment of the kitchen.

\subsection{Limitation}
While the re-enactment method provided in-depth qualitative insights, it is limited by its artificial nature. Individuals may have maintained a higher hygiene standard or a more cautious knife skill than they would in a natural setting due to the feeling of being "monitored". Furthermore, the small sample size may not capture the diversity of cooking rituals.


\subsection{Self Reflection}

The use of FigJam allowed all the researchers to work collaboratively in real-time, allowing everyone to see interesting quotes and codes. The platform enables the possibility of identifying patterns that one person might have missed. Furthermore, a live-coding session was also conducted in order for researchers to provide live feedbacks during the analysis. 

A significant challenge was encountered during the thematic analysis, in which there is the tendency for researchers to apply interpretive 'why' labels during the initial coding, rather than sticking to descriptive 'what' label. The researchers recognized that these 'incorrect' or premature labels could negatively impact the subsequent pattern identification process. To mitigate this, multiple iterations of the coding process were required to ensure that the final themes were based in actual observed behaviors rather than early researcher assumptions. Moreover, this challenge emphasized the importance of live-coding sessions, as it allows the researchers to resolve disagreements on labels earlier, rather than waiting for later iterations.

Regarding the data collection process, having a single researcher to facilitate re-enactments was an intentional decision to optimize time efficiency. However, we reflect that having multiple researchers present might have enhanced problem identification during the data collection process, allowing for a higher quality data result. If the study were to be rerun, we would have likely improved the data collection process by increasing the number of researchers in a session. We would also increase the time investment in order to conduct a higher amount of live-coding session, ensuring the smoothness of each process.
